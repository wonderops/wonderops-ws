From its beginnings, WonderOps has supported building the ideas of entrepreneurs with software development. Today, we work with our technology partners to build web and mobile based software in technologies such as Java, Ruby on Rails, Android and iOS. The technology partners we work are not only great at software development, but we have created a partnership that allows us to integrate into our managed services practice. This allows us to create a continuous delivery of software and deploy frequently. Many of our partners also have offshore resources as part of their staff. This allows the WonderOps customers to take advantage of offshore pricing while not having the difficulties of managing international resources. This provides our customers a cost effective software development model not of often available to small businesses.
