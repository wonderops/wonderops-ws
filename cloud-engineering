Amazon Web Services is the new data center. At WonderOps, we only provide support for the AWS platform. Because of our focus, we know we can provide our clients with the depth of knowledge necessary for the clear market leader in cloud services. 

<br><br>

There primary way in which we engage with our customers for AWS services is through providing staff augmentation. We bring the professionally certified expertise to you in house so that our engineers can work side by side with your teams to achieve your goals. It is not uncommon for companies to have a transition gap from data center to the cloud where the system administration expertise requires time to acclimate to the new ways of performing within AWS. In addition to that direct client support, we are also here to help you with your migration to the AWS cloud. 


<br><br>

Migration to the cloud often involves people and process changes in addition to the technology change. We have the experience you need to help you with that transition. We are strong advocates for automation as a tenet for leveraging the cloud. Why move to a software driven infrastructure model without fully capitalizing on the advantages? WonderOps has DevOps experience specifically with AWS services that will help your company go beyond building servers in the cloud. We help you architect and implement a future automated DevOps model in the AWS cloud that can change the game. 
<br><br>

Whether it is automation, migration, or support the AWS professionally certified staff at WonderOps is the right choice for supporting your AWS cloud objectives.
