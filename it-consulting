The design of DevOps is to optimize release management and maximize the predictability, efficiency, security and management of operational support. At WonderOps, our DevOps solution is interdependent with our information security focus for an end to end agile and secure service deployment. There are some key benefits to the DevOps philosophy. Bringing software development and operations together has big advantages such as reduction of friction at the time of integration. WonderOps can provide the full advantages of a complete DevOps integration or simply software development within the scope of a project using agile development.

From its beginnings, WonderOps has supported building the ideas of entrepreneurs with software development. We began by providing project level web application software development for emerging startups, providing a cost effective Minimal Viable Product (MVP). That company tradition continues today as we continue to offer a startup friendly package to build cost effective web applications using Ruby on Rails. WonderOps continues to be a best option for startups faced with no outside funding or for angel investors needing to ensure the application they are investing in gets properly built. When others can't make it work, WonderOps supports emerging early stage startups, helping you get your Minimum Viable Product built and to market.
