	Companies everywhere, of all sizes are discovering the advantages of integrating their businesses with cloud computing. However, transitioning elements of operations to a cloud provider adds new risks and new responsibiities for tenants. Using cloud services requires companies to transform IT service models and the development of new processes and procedures for operations. Wrongfully, many companies assume data protection is transferred to the cloud service provider. The responsibility for data protection remains with the owner of the data. Companies selecting cloud computing as a strategy must evaluate the operational impact for their applications.
