If you are reading this page, I am going to make an assumption about you. I am going to assume you have heard of DevOps and have your own opinion of what DevOps is. This page is here to share my definition and experience of what DevOps is so that you have a better understanding of WonderOps in that context. 

<br><br>
I like this definition by Atlassian: <br>
"DevOps is a set of practices that automates the processes between software development and IT teams, in order that they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably." 
<br><br>

I would emphasize in that definition the word processes. DevOps is not simply a tool discussion. A company can take advantage of DevOps only to the degree that its processes and behavior can support it. I also believe based on experience that an organization size plays a role in the appetite of a company to adopt all of DevOps. However, DevOps is not, in our opinion, an all or nothing proposition. Some people view DevOps as a spectrum that organizations sit upon. Doing DevOps is a journey and will continue to evolve as an industry. 
<br><br>

WonderOps can partner with you in a couple of ways. We can help you make some choices on where to start or go next based on the maturity of where you are now with DevOps. Or we can simply help you with some of the work you are already on a path of. Either way, this is what we love to do and are eager to meet new people and help like-minded organizations.
