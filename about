        	<h2>About WonderOps</h2>
             <div class="why-cho_inner_subtext"><img src="./images/hat-wand.jpg">

WonderOps started with an idea on how to help startups with technology. We originally built a startup pack that was designed to help entrepreneurs launch into business without having to find the elusive "Technical Co-Founder". We became the co-founder. We worked with companies in the US, India, China and Africa. 
<br><br>

Fast-forward to today and things are very different, but in some ways still the same. We are an IT company that continues to want to add value, be a change agent, and make a difference. Our priority is to provide good people for our clients to build awesome teams with. What makes us different is the mission at the heart of our company.  
<br><br>

Our mission is to disrupt gender discrimination in the workplace by increasing opportunity for women in technology. We focus on attracting top female talent who help our clients realize the benefits of a gender diverse technical team. Gender diversity in the workplace has been directly linked to greater collaboration, higher productivity and increased financial outcomes. Yet as the IT industry in the United States continues to grow, women's participation is shrinking. The result is a weakened technology ecosystem where organizations are unable to achieve their best results. 
<br><br>

Our company culture has evolved to center around creating a destination workplace for women in information technology and a reliable place for companies to turn to for top female IT talent. Our priority will always remain providing the best resource to our clients for their needs, male or female. However, we believe providing opportunities for women in IT and enabling gender diversity for our clients is our purpose.
